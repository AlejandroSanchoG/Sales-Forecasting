One of the biggest challenges for the company is to be able to determine, in advance, what levels of sales each item will have in the different stores it operates. The company’s internal data is used to build predictive models with this aim, but this is not sufficient, as the sale of an item will be affected by different factors beyond the company in different markets. Those factors could be features from the market, or even from the location itself, having an impact on the level of sales.

The aim of this project is to determine what type of external information is relevant when making a sales forecast in units, and to propose an algorithm that uses this information to estimate the sales of each item by market and / or location.
